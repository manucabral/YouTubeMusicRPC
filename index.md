## :grey_question: How does that work
The application opens your browser with remote debugging enable (Chrome Dev Tools) to access all Youtube Music tabs, once this is done the app executes a script to obtain all the data throught [MediaSession](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSession) and finally create a Rich Presence for Discord.

## üî® Troubleshooting
- My rich presence client is not displaying?
  - Try
    - Go to your User Settings > Activity Status > Display current activity as a status message and make sure it's enabled.
    - Close the app and wait a few seconds, then open it again.
- Do I need Discord open on my pc to use this app?
    - Yes, you need to open Discord to run the app.
- The app crashes on start
    - Try
        - Close all browser instances and run it again.
        - If you've Youtube Music Desktop Application close it too.
          - I recommended to close instances from the task manager.
        - Restart discord and open it again.
    - If the problem persist please make an issue and adjunt your __client.log__ file.
