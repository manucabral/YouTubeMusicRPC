## üìùNotes
- Currently only compatible with Microsoft Windows systems.

## :grey_question: How does that work
The application opens your browser with remote debugging enabled (Chrome Dev Tools) to access all YouTube Music tabs. Once this is done, the app executes a script to obtain all the data through [MediaSession](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSession) and finally creates a Rich Presence for Discord.

## üî® Troubleshooting
- My Rich Presence client is not displaying.
  - Try the following:
    - Go to your User Settings > Activity Status > Display current activity as a status message and make sure it's enabled.
    - Close the app and wait a few seconds, then open it again.
- Do I need Discord open on my PC to use this app?
  - Yes, you need to have Discord open to run the app.
- The app crashes on startup.
  - Try the following:
    - Close all browser instances and run it again.
    - If you have the YouTube Music Desktop Application open, close it as well. I recommend closing instances from the task manager.
    - Restart Discord and try opening the app again.
  - If the problem persists, please create an issue and attach your `client.log` file.
